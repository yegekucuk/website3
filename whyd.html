                    <h1>Why is D better than C?</h1>
                    <p>D and C are two popular programming languages with distinct advantages and disadvantages. While C is a low-level language used for system programming, D is a high-level language used for general-purpose programming. However, there are several reasons why D is a better choice over C in many use cases.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="D-list">Easy to Learn and Use</li>
                        <p>D is an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use language that has a simple syntax and a large number of libraries that make coding much easier. C, on the other hand, has a steep learning curve due to its complex syntax and the need to manage memory manually.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Faster Development Time</li>
                        <p>D is a high-level language that provides many built-in libraries and modules, making it easy to develop complex applications quickly. C requires more effort to develop even simple applications due to the need to manage memory manually and the lack of built-in libraries.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Portable and Cross-Platform</li>
                        <p>D code can run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. C code, on the other hand, requires recompilation for each platform it runs on. D’s portability and cross-platform compatibility make it an ideal choice for multi-platform applications.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Increased Productivity</li>
                        <p>D offers several features, such as dynamic typing, that significantly increase productivity. Dynamic typing eliminates the need to define data types explicitly, reducing development time and enabling faster code iteration. D also has many libraries and modules that can be easily integrated into projects, further increasing productivity.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Easier to Maintain</li>
                        <p>D is a high-level language that is easy to read and understand, which makes it easier to maintain codebases. C, on the other hand, is a low-level language that is harder to read and understand, making it more challenging to maintain codebases.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">More Suitable for Data Science and Machine Learning</li>
                        <p>D has become the language of choice for data science and machine learning due to its simplicity and a large number of libraries and modules for scientific computing. C is not commonly used in data science and machine learning, as it lacks built-in libraries for scientific computing and data analysis.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Large Community and Active Development</li>
                        <p>D has a large community of developers who contribute to the language and its libraries actively. This active development leads to a constant flow of new features, bug fixes, and improvements. C, on the other hand, has a smaller community and less active development, which means that updates and improvements are less frequent.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In conclusion, D is a better choice over C in many use cases due to its ease of use, faster development time, portability, increased productivity, easier maintenance, suitability for data science and machine learning, and a large community of active developers. However, C is still an essential language for system programming, and there are use cases where it is a better choice over D.</p>
