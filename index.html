                    <h1>What is D?</h1>
                    <p>D is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used in software development, data science, machine learning, web development, and many other fields. Created in the late 2022 by MARUN, D has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world due to its simplicity, versatility, and ease of use.</p>
                    <h3>Here are some key features of D:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="D-list">Easy to Learn and Use</li>
                        <p>D has a simple and easy-to-understand syntax that makes it an ideal language for beginners. The language's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, which makes it easy to read and understand even for non-programmers.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Interpreted Language</li>
                        <p>D is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line by line, making it easier to debug and test. This also means that D code can be run on any platform without the need for recompilation.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Dynamic Typing</li>
                        <p>D is a dynamically typed language, which means that you do not need to declare the data type of a variable before using it. This makes it easier to write code and faster to develop.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Large Standard Library</li>
                        <p>D comes with a large standard library that includes modules for tasks such as data processing, web development, machine learning, and more. This makes it easier for developers to build complex applications without having to write everything from scratch  </p>
                        <li class="D-list">Object-Oriented</li>
                        <p>D is an object-oriented language, which means that it uses objects and classes to organize and structure code. This makes it easier to write reusable and modular code, which can save time and effort in development.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Cross-Platform</li>
                        <p>D code can be run on any platform, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it easier to develop and deploy applications that can run on multiple platforms without the need for additional code.</p>
                        <li class="D-list">Strong Community and Active Development</li>
                        <p>D has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the language and its libraries. This community ensures that D is constantly improving, and new features and updates are released regularly.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Applications of D:</h3>
                    <p>D can be used in a wide range of applications, including:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Data Science:</b> D has become the language of choice for data science due to its large number of libraries and modules for scientific computing, data analysis, and visualization.</li>
                        <li><b>Machine Learning:</b> D is widely used in machine learning due to its simplicity, ease of use, and large number of libraries for machine learning, such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.</li>
                        <li><b>Game Development:</b> D can be used to develop games using popular game engines such as Pygame and Panda3D.</li>
                        <li><b>Desktop Applications:</b> D can be used to develop desktop applications using frameworks such as DQt and wxD.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In conclusion, D is a versatile and easy-to-learn language that can be used in a wide range of applications, from web development to machine learning. Its simplicity, readability, and large standard library make it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced developers alike. With an active community and continuous development, D is set to remain one of the most popular programming languages for years to come.</p>
